## Extract 2025 Data to CSV (2/23/2025, 10:18:10 AM)

_**User**_

delete all data before year 2025's  of miscellaneous table and id is above 5000 . use mcp@.env 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you delete the data from the miscellaneous table based on your criteria. First, I'll connect to the database using the credentials from your .env file, and then execute the delete query.

Let me first connect to the database:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Now, I'll execute the DELETE query with your specified conditions:

---

_****_



---

_****_



I notice there was an error because I assumed the date column name. Let me check the table structure first to see the correct column name:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Now I can see the correct column names. Let me modify the DELETE query with the correct column names:

---

_****_



---

_****_



The deletion has been completed successfully. Here's what was done:
- Deleted records from the `miscellaneous` table where:
  - The year of `createdat` is before 2025
  - The `idMiscellaneous` is greater than 5000

The operation affected 1,444 rows in the database. Is there anything else you would like me to help you with?

verify it

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll verify the deletion by checking if there are any remaining records that match the previous criteria. Let me run a SELECT query to confirm:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Let me also check the current distribution of records to give you a complete picture:

---

_****_



---

_****_



The verification confirms that:

1. There are **zero** records remaining that match the deletion criteria (records before 2025 with ID > 5000)
2. Current data distribution shows:
   - 2022: 3,650 records (IDs between 22 and 546)
   - 2023: 15,850 records (IDs between 22 and 624)
   - 2024: 26,917 records (IDs between 1 and 870)
   - 2025: 8,689 records (IDs between 53 and 50024)

The deletion was successful as there are no records left that match the criteria we used (pre-2025 with ID > 5000). All remaining records either:
- Have IDs below 5000 for years before 2025
- Or are from the year 2025

Would you like me to perform any additional verification checks?

dump as csv in @New folder 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you dump the miscellaneous table data into a CSV file in a new folder. First, let's create a command to make the directory and then export the data.

---

_****_

```bash
mkdir -p New
```

```
PS M:\project\internship\plant-watering-admin-dashboard> mkdir -p New


    Directory: M:\project\internship\plant-watering-admin-dashboard


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
d-----        23-02-2025     13:26                New


PS M:\project\internship\plant-watering-admin-dashboard>
```

---

_****_



Now, let's create a query to export the data to a CSV file. I'll use MySQL's `INTO OUTFILE` functionality with proper CSV formatting:

---

_****_



---

_****_



I apologize for the error. It seems we can't directly use MySQL's `INTO OUTFILE` due to security restrictions. Let's try an alternative approach using the MySQL command line tool:

---

_****_

```bash
mysql -h localhost -u root -p182003 greenbalconydrip -e "SELECT idMiscellaneous, subject, reading, createdat FROM miscellaneous" -B > New/miscellaneous_dump.csv
```

```
PS M:\project\internship\plant-watering-admin-dashboard> mysql -h localhost -u root -p182003 greenbalcony


```

---

_****_



I notice we're having some issues with the direct command line approach. Let me try a different approach using a PowerShell command that works with the MCP database connection:

---

_****_



---

_****_



I see that the data is quite large and getting truncated in the response. Let me modify the query to get it in chunks and write it to a file:

---

_****_

```bash
echo "idMiscellaneous,subject,reading,createdat" > New/miscellaneous_dump.csv
```

```
PS M:\project\internship\plant-watering-admin-dashboard> echo "idMiscellaneous,subject,reading,createdat"
 > New/miscellaneous_dump.csv
PS M:\project\internship\plant-watering-admin-dashboard>
```

Now let's get the data in chunks:
