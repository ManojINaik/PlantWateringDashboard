Okay, the user is asking about how sensor data is processed and displayed. Let me break this down.

First, I need to consider the typical workflow for sensor data. Usually, it involves collection, processing, storage, and visualization. So, I'll outline each step.

Starting with data collection: sensors generate raw data, which could be analog or digital. They might use protocols like I2C or SPI. Then, the data is read by a microcontroller or a computer.

Next, processing. The raw data often needs calibration. For example, converting ADC readings to actual temperature values. There might be filtering to remove noiseâ€”maybe using a moving average or a low-pass filter. Also, error checking is important to handle faulty readings.

Storage comes next. Depending on the application, data might be stored locally on an SD card or transmitted to a database. Time-stamping each data point is crucial for tracking.

For visualization, real-time displays could use graphs or gauges. Web interfaces with charts.js or plotting libraries like Matplotlib in Python are common. Mobile apps might show the data through dashboards.

I should provide a simple code example. Maybe an Arduino reading a temperature sensor, applying a moving average filter, and sending data over serial. Then a Python script to plot it. That covers both processing and display.

I need to mention common tools: serial monitors, IoT platforms like ThingsBoard, and databases like InfluxDB with Grafana for dashboards. Also, mention visualization libraries.

Make sure the explanation is clear for someone who might not be familiar with all the steps. Keep it structured but not too technical. Check if the example code is understandable and relevant.

Here's a typical workflow for sensor data processing and visualization:

1. **Data Collection**:
```arduino
// Sensor reading example (e.g., temperature)
float readSensor() {
  float rawValue = analogRead(SENSOR_PIN);
  // Convert analog reading to actual temperature
  float temperature = (rawValue * 5.0 / 1024.0) * 100; 
  return temperature;
}
```

2. **Data Processing**:
```python
# Example data processing pipeline
def process_data(raw_data):
    # 1. Filter noise
    filtered = low_pass_filter(raw_data)
    
    # 2. Calibration adjustment
    calibrated = filtered * calibration_factor + offset
    
    # 3. Unit conversion
    converted = celsius_to_fahrenheit(calibrated) if USE_F else calibrated
    
    return converted
```

3. **Data Visualization** (common approaches):
```javascript:web-dashboard.js
// Example using Chart.js for web display
const ctx = document.getElementById('sensorChart').getContext('2d');
const chart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: {
        labels: timestamps,
        datasets: [{
            label: 'Temperature',
            data: sensorValues,
            borderColor: 'rgb(75, 192, 192)'
        }]
    }
});
```

Common visualization patterns:
- Real-time updating line charts
- Gauges/dials for current values
- Heat maps for spatial data
- Historical data tables
- Alert indicators for threshold breaches

Typical processing steps:
1. Raw data acquisition
2. Signal conditioning (filtering, amplification)
3. Analog-to-digital conversion
4. Calibration/linearization
5. Error checking
6. Data formatting
7. Storage/transmission
8. Visualization rendering

Would you like me to focus on any specific aspect of this pipeline?
