@.cursorrules  fix it its showing all as no data.

fix by utilizing sql and browser-tool mcp

I'll help you fix the issue where all the flow statuses are showing as "no data". Let's analyze and fix this step by step.

First, let me check the current database structure and data.

I see we need to establish the correct database connection first. Let me check the network logs to see what database connection is being used by the application.

Let me check the console logs for any database-related errors:

Let me check the codebase to see how the database connection is configured:

I see that we need to fix the database connection and data retrieval. Let me try connecting to the database with the credentials I found in the codebase:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Great! Now that we're connected, let's check the tables in the database:

---

_****_



---

_****_





Let's examine the structure of the relevant tables:

---

_****_



---

_****_



---

_****_



Now let's write a query to get the data we need for the dashboard. We need to combine the schedule information with the watering status from the history:

---

_****_



---

_****_



I apologize for the complex query. Let's break it down into simpler parts:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Now let's check the data_history1 table for today's and yesterday's watering events:

---

_****_



---

_****_



I see the issue now. The problem is that there are no watering events (W1) or configuration runs (getconfigrun) in the data_history1 table for today or yesterday. This is why all the flows are showing as "no data".

Let me check if we have any data at all in the data_history1 table:

---

_****_



---

_****_





Let me check what kind of data we actually have in the data_history1 table:

---

_****_



---

_****_



---

_**User**_

dont use datahistroy1 table. use miscellaneous and schedule table.

for more use 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. Let's work with the `miscellaneous` and `schedule` tables instead. First, let me check the structure of the `miscellaneous` table:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Let me check some sample data from the miscellaneous table to understand what we're working with:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Let me check if we have any data at all in the miscellaneous table:

---

_****_



---

_****_





Now I understand the data structure! Let me write a query that combines the schedule and miscellaneous tables to show the correct flow status:
