Okay, the user wants me to search the console logs and fix any issues. But they didn't provide specific logs or code. Hmm, I need to ask for more details. Without knowing what the errors or logs are, I can't pinpoint the problem. Maybe they're encountering runtime errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior. I should request the specific console messages they're seeing and the relevant code sections. That way, I can analyze the logs, identify the root cause, and suggest precise fixes. It's important to get the exact error messages and code context to provide an accurate solution. Let me prompt them to share those details.

To help fix console log issues, I'll need more specific information about:

1. The exact error messages/warnings you're seeing in the console
2. The relevant code sections where these logs are being generated
3. The context of what you're trying to achieve

Could you please share:
- Screenshot/text of the console errors
- The corresponding code file(s) where the logged operations occur
- What type of application you're working with (React, Node.js, etc.)

This will help me provide a targeted solution to resolve the console issues while maintaining proper MCP server connections and project requirements.
