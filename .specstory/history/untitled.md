_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix the hydration error. This error occurs when the server-rendered content doesn't match what React tries to render on the client side. In your case, it's happening with time values where there's a one-second difference between server and client rendering.

Let me search for the relevant code first.

I see the issue. Let me modify the TimeDate component to ensure it works correctly:
